            <h1>Every idea <img src="assets/img/idea.png"><br> starts with a<br> need</h1>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers.
                I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my
                cell phone,
                I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought.
                I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface,
                I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not
                solve any problem.</p>

                    As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You
                    will
                    learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
